* TODO: MAKE SURE that the calls to clear_frame()/set_frame() are correct, AND that the logic of those functions (and test_frame) is correct! The current implementations differ from JamesM's code, because that didn't make much sense (unless other code or the CPU for some reason modify page->frame by dividing it by 0x1000...)
* TODO: set up a separate double fault handler (see OSDev / Triple_Fault)
* TODO: heap contraction if more than enough space is free (and thus wasted from other tasks)
