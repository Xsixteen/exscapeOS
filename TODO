* Console stuff:
	* "clear" command in the user mode shell
	* Color support (ANSI escapes?)
	Combined, this likely means adding some terminfo-ish terminal support; I have *NO* idea how that works, so it'll have to wait a bit.

* Increase userspace stack size dynamically on page faults, up to at least several MB
* Copy-on-write fork()

* FAT: write support!
* DMA for ATA transfers?
* Signal support
* Improve the user-mode shell
	* Pipe support
	* Better parsing, e.g. 2>&1 works the same as 2> &1 does now; echo a>b writes 'a' to the file 'b' even without the space in between, etc.
* Pipes
* Proper VFS
* Implement the remaining syscalls for Newlib
* Implement queues for mutexes
* Directory caching - searching and stat()ing a "large" (20+ entries) directory is slow! 100+ is *very* slow!
