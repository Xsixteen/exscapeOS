* DMA for ATA transfers? If not: READ MULTIPLE to speed up slightly
* FAT: read multiple clusters at once, if continuous on disk and request is > 1 cluster size
* Keyboard input: pass more info to userland, so that e.g. ^C and ^D could work.
* Signal support
* fork + execve
* User-mode shell (I've already written a half-finished one)
* Pipes
* Proper VFS
* Implement the remaining syscalls for Newlib
* Implement queues for mutexes
* Directory caching - searching and stat()ing a "large" (20+ entries) directory is slow! 100+ is *very* slow!
