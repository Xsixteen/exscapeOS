* Console stuff:
	* "clear" command in the user mode shell
	* Color support (ANSI escapes?)
	Combined, this likely means adding some terminfo-ish terminal support; I have *NO* idea how that works, so it'll have to wait a bit.

* Copy-on-write fork()

* Rewrite the sleep/block system to handle:
	* sleep()
	* wait*()
	* mutexes
	* I/O (pipes, ATA)

* Pipes:
	* Proper blocking, including notifying tasks waiting when the last reader/writer is closed

* initrd:
	* Document the new initrd format (create_initrd.py, initrd.c)

* Try to recreate and fix the OS not running under QEMU 1.0 (qemu-kvm-1.0/x86_64)

* Improve the user-mode shell
	* Tab completion escaping (also add support for escaped spaces in argument parsing)
	* Pipe support
	* ; && and ||
	* !! and !cmd (and perhaps !-n) to look through history
	* Better parsing, e.g. 2>&1 works the same as 2> &1 does now; echo a>b writes 'a' to the file 'b' even without the space in between, etc.

* ext2:
	* Further work on symlinks, especially in expanding them prior to applying .. etc
	* ext2_read()

* FAT: write support!
* DMA for ATA transfers?
* Signal support
* Proper VFS
* Implement the remaining syscalls for Newlib
* Implement queues for mutexes
* Directory caching - searching and stat()ing a "large" (20+ entries) directory is slow! 100+ is *very* slow!
