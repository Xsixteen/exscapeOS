* TODO: set up a separate double fault handler (see OSDev / Triple_Fault)

1) Multitasking - first part is complete! (Kernel mode only; no separate address spaces)
2) Consoles?
3) User mode (including system calls)
4) ELF parsing + executable loading (from the initrd)?
* Serial port output (for debugging)?
