* FAT: write support!
* DMA for ATA transfers?
* Keyboard input: pass more info to userland, so that e.g. ^C and ^D could work.
* Signal support
* Improve the user-mode shell
* Pipes
* Proper VFS
* Implement the remaining syscalls for Newlib
* Implement queues for mutexes
* Directory caching - searching and stat()ing a "large" (20+ entries) directory is slow! 100+ is *very* slow!
