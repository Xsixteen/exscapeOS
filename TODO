* TODO: set up a separate double fault handler (see OSDev / Triple_Fault)
* TODO: implement mutexes and start placing them where needed

1) Multitasking - first part is complete! (Kernel mode only; no separate address spaces)
2) Consoles - pretty much complete; they are hardly great, but appears to work
3) ATA driver (PIO only to begin with)

Stuff that need fixing:
* Add a proper HLT task that doesn't steal useful CPU time or slow down the disk

3) User mode (including system calls)
4) ELF parsing + executable loading (from the initrd)?
* Serial port output (for debugging)?
