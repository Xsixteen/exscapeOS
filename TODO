	* "clear" command in the user mode shell
	* Color support (ANSI escapes?)
	Combined, this likely means adding some terminfo-ish terminal support; I have *NO* idea how that works, so it'll have to wait a bit.

* FAT: write support!
* DMA for ATA transfers?
* Signal support
* Improve the user-mode shell
* Pipes
* Proper VFS
* Implement the remaining syscalls for Newlib
* Implement queues for mutexes
* Directory caching - searching and stat()ing a "large" (20+ entries) directory is slow! 100+ is *very* slow!
